# Word Frequency Counter

This Python project aims to analyze the frequency of words in a given text and generate a CSV file containing the word-frequency pairs. It provides a simple and efficient way to extract insights from textual data.

### Features:

- **Text Cleaning**: Utilizes regular expressions to remove punctuations and special characters from the input text, ensuring accurate word frequency analysis.
  
- **Word Frequency Analysis**: Counts the occurrence of each word in the cleaned text and generates a dictionary mapping each word to its frequency.

- **CSV Export**: Writes the word-frequency pairs to a CSV file for further analysis or visualization in other tools.

### How to Use:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
   
2. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
   
3. Modify the `text` variable in the script to your desired input text.
   
4. Run the script, and it will generate a CSV file named `wordcount.csv` containing the word-frequency pairs.

### Why Use This Project?

- **Efficiency**: Quickly analyze the distribution of words in any text.
  
- **Flexibility**: Easily adapt the script to suit your specific text analysis needs.
  
- **Educational**: Understand the basics of text processing and data analysis using Python.
